ECSE 427 ASSIGNMENT 2

TEST 1:
If test 1 fails, please try it again a few more times. It works most of the time, but sometimes FIFO fails, either:
(1) With a seg fault coming from an invalid write at a2_test.c:149 (not traceable to my program through valgrind).
(2) With missing values that should have been read, but weren't due to collisions.

At time of submission, my program passes this test perfectly 5 times per 10 trials.

TEST 2:
The synchronization tests work perfectly with errors of approximately 2 error per 2000 rounds

TEST READ_EVAL:
Be sure to compile with -lrt and -lpthread. There is a bug here since I don't unlink the shared mem at the end, so you can't reuse shared memory names. (If you do, it'll say something like "can't find sem_write.c").

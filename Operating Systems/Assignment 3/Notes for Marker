Notes for Marker

-I don't have much to say. Run the attached sfs_api.c. Both tests provided on mycourses should run with 0 errors or warnings (tested on Linux machines 3rd floor Trottier). Valgrind should show no memory leaks.

-I did not implement commit/restore (would have loved to but just didn't have the time).

-I know my code is a bit sloppy, I have some aspects leftover from when I was implementing commit/restore that I may have forgot to clean up. Hopefully it's tidy enough.

-If this is Xiru or the other TA, thanks for a great semester. I learned a lot in OS!
